# Classification of Diabetic Retinal Images using CNNs

## Abstract 
How well can we classify the four stages of diabetic retinal disease using a neural net?

## Design
Set up code to take image files and convert into file structure needed by Keras image utilities. 

## Data
Dataset was found on Kaggle.com of 3000+ images of diabetic and normal retina scans, replacing original retina dataset of 600 images determined to be too short. 

## Algorithms 
Used Keras deep learning library to both build CNN model and use pretrained model MobileNet as a base 

Tools

Jupyter Notebook to write / execute Python code
Pandas / Numpy libraries for data manipulation
Mathplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
Keras for neural network libraries
Communication Findings are consolidated in a Keynote presentation and the supporting Jupyter notebooks can be found here. (Prep_ notebooks contain EDA and export versions of the feature (X) dataframe Model_ notebooks load the saved dataframes and execute the various models)
