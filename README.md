# eye_disease
Deep learning project with eye images

The data (from on Kaggle) is a set of high resolution retinal images (~600 images) with each image labeled as normal, cataract, glaucoma, or retinal disease.

Initial stage will be to build a binary classification model - normal or diseased.

Assuming reasonable results, followup work will be a multi-class model - normal, cataract, glaucoma, or retinal disease.
